SHORT DESCRIPTION

        Provisioning lab environments requires a PowerShell Desired State Configuration (.psd1) document. Lability
        uses the configuration document to create and configure virtual machines and networking. Additional metadata
        can be added to the configuration document to instruct Lability to perform specific configuration actions.

LONG DESCRIPTION

        When provisioning lab environments, a PowerShell Desired State Configuration document (.psd1) is required. The
        configuration document contains an AllNodes array of hashtables containing node information. Each node is
        parsed to determine the number and names of virtual machines to provision.

        To customise the provisioned virtual machines, additional metadata can be added to the configuration (.psd1)
        document. If no additional metadata is defined within the configuration document, Lability will provision all
        virtual machines with default values, e.g. a default operating system, memory configuration and a virtual
        switch. The default virtual machine values can be retrieved by running the following command:

            PS C:\> Get-LabVMDefault

        The default value applied to each individual virtual machine can be altered without changing the default
        values applied to all VMs. To override the default values for a virtual machine, additional metadata can be
        added to the node's configuration. For example, to alter the number of processors assigned to all VMs to 2,
        the `Lability_ProcessorCount` property can be set on each node:

            @{
                AllNodes = @(
                    @{
                        NodeName = 'VM01';
                        Lability_ProcessorCount = 2;
                    }
                    @{
                        NodeName = 'VM02';
                        Lability_ProcessorCount = 2;
                    }
                )
            }

        Lability also supports using the all nodes/wilcard node. The following example will also configure all VMs
        with a processor count of 2:

            @{
                AllNodes = @(
                    @{
                        NodeName = '*';
                        Lability_ProcessorCount = 2;
                    }
                    @{
                        NodeName = 'VM01';
                    }
                    @{
                        NodeName = 'VM02';
                    }
                )
            }

        NOTE: the 'Lability_' prefix is optional, but is recommended to avoid clashes with existing properties.
