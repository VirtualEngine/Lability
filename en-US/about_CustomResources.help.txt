SHORT DESCRIPTION

        Custom resources are binary files that can be deployed into virtual machines' VHD(X) disk file.

LONG DESCRIPTION

        Most lab environments require additional binary resources to be able to provision them end-to-end. These
        resources may include .EXE, .MSI, .ISO and/or .ZIP files.
        
        Custom resources are defined in the NonNodeData section of the PowerShell DSC configuration document (.psd1)
        and then referenced within each node where the resource is required. This process permits injecting a
        resource into more than a single virtual machine if required.
        
        When defining custom resources, the Uri property can point to a http://, https:// or file:// location.
        NOTE: Be careful when distributing lab configuration documents that contain file Uris.

                            ## to False.

RESOURCE DOWNLOAD

        When a lab configuration is started, Lability will automatically download all missing media and custom
        resources. In some scenarios you many need to download all required resources in advance, e.g. where internet
        access is not readily available or permitted. The `Invoke-LabResourceDownload` cmdlet can be used to manually
        download all required resources.

        All downloaded resources are cached in the host's 'ResourcePath'. This path can be found by running the
        following command:
        
            PS C:\> Get-LabHostDefault
            
        Use the `Set-LabHostDefault` cmdlet to set the host's 'ResourcePath' property. For example        

COMPRESSED RESOURCES

        Custom resources/media may be downloaded in a compressed foramt, i.e. ZIP files. Lability supports
        decompressing or expanding .ISO and .ZIP resources into a node's VHD(X) file when the VM is created. To expand
        a resource you need to set the 'Expand' property on the resource to '$true'. By default no resources are
        automatically expanded.
        
        When expanding .ISO and .ZIP resources, they are placed into the \Resources\<ResourceId> folder. For example,
        an .ISO resource with the Id of 'MyCustomIso' when set to expand, would be expanded into the
        C:\Resources\MyCustomIso folder of the target node.
        
        NOTE: the compressed resource is still downloaded and stored on the host machine. 
        
MANUAL RESOURCE DOWNLOAD

        It is also possible to manually prestage resources by placing them in the host's 'ResourcePath' directory.
        If an existing filename (and checksum) already matches a resource definition, Lability will not attempt to
        download it again.
        
        For example, when using the above configuration, manually placing a 'MyCustomResource.zip' file in the host's
        'ResourcePath' directory will ensure that the file will not be downloaded (as there is no checksum). However,
        if a MD5 checksum is defined, only if the MD5 checksum matches, it will won't be downloaded again.
        
        NOTE: if a MD5 checksum is incorrect, Lablility will always attempt to download the resource.
