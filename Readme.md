# Lability #

<img align="right" alt="Lability logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VirtualEngine/Lability/dev/Lability.png">

The __Lability__ module enables simple provisioning of Windows Hyper-V development and testing
environments. It uses a declarative document for machine configuration. However, rather than
defining configurations in an external custom domain-specific language (DSL) document, __Lability__
extends existing PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration (.psd1) documents with
metadata that can be interpreted by the module.

By using this approach, it allows the use of a single configuration document to describe all
properties for provisioning Windows-centric development and/or test environments.

The __Lability__ module will parse the DSC configuration document and provision Hyper-V virtual
machines according to the metadata contained within. When invoked, __Lability__ will parse a DSC
configuration document and automagically provision the following resources:

* Virtual machine disk images
  * Download required evaluation Operating System installation media
  * Expand Windows Image (WIM) image files into Sysprep'd virtual machine parent disks, including Server 2016 TP4 and Nano server
  * Apply required/recommended DSC Windows updates
* Virtual networks
  * Create internal and external Hyper-V switches
* Virtual machines
  * Connect to the correct virtual switches
  * Inject DSC resources from the host machine
  * Inject a dynamically created Unattend.xml file
  * Inject external ISO, EXE and ZIP resources
  * Inject the virtual machine's DSC document
  * Invoke the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) after Sysprep


## Examples ##

An example DSC configuration document might look the following. __Note:__ this is a standard DSC
.psd1 configuration document, but has been extended with specific properties which the __Lability__
module can interpret.

```powershell
@{
    AllNodes = @(
        @{
            NodeName                = 'DC1';
            Lability_ProcessorCount = 2;
            Lability_SwitchName     = 'CORPNET';
            Lability_Media          = '2016_x64_Datacenter_EN_Eval';
        },
        @{
            NodeName                = 'APP1';
            Lability_ProcessorCount = 1;
            Lability_SwitchName     = 'CORPNET';
            Lability_Media          = '2016_x64_Datacenter_EN_Eval';
        }
    )
    NonNodeData = @{
        Lability = @{
            Network = @(
                @{
                    Name = 'CORPNET';
                    Type = 'Internal';
                }
            ) #end Network
        } #end Lability
    } #end NonNodeData
}
```

When `Start-LabConfiguration` is invoked with the above configuration document, it will:

* Create an internal Hyper-V virtual switch named 'CORPNET'
  * If no network is defined, a default internal virtual switch will automatically be created
* Download required Server 2012 R2 Standard Edition evaluation media
  * Create a Sysprep'd Server 2012 R2 Standard Edition parent VHDX
  * Install required/recommended DSC hotfixes
* Provision two Hyper-V virtual machines called 'DC1' and 'APP1'
  * Each VM will be given 2GB RAM (configurable default)
  * 'DC1' will be assigned 2 virtual CPUs
  * 'APP1' will be assigned 1 virtual CPU
  * Attach each virtual machine to the 'CORPNET' virtual switch
  * Create differencing VHDX for each VM
  * Inject a dynamically created Unattend.xml file into the differencing VHDX

More examples can be found in the [.\Examples](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability/tree/master/Examples) folder
of the module's root directory.
